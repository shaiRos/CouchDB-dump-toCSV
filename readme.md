use couchdb-dump.sh to create dump json file for a database in a couchdb instance (see inside for instructions) (from: https://github.com/danielebailo/couchdb-dump)
use git bash cmd!! not wsl/normal cmd bash to run .sh file

use couchdb-dump-ToCSV.js to convert that dump data to csv (change file name to file generated by couchdb-dump)
